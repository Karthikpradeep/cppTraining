FILE HANDLING

In C++, files are mainly dealt by using three classes fstream, ifstream, ofstream.

-> ofstream: This Stream class signifies the output file stream and is applied to create files for writing information to files
-> ifstream: This Stream class signifies the input file stream and is applied for reading information from files
-> fstream: This Stream class can be used for both read and write from/to files.

C++ provides us with the following operations in File Handling:

 - Creating a file: open()
 - Reading data: read()
 - Writing new data: write()
 - Closing a file: close()
 
 Opening a File -
 	void open(const char* file_name,ios::openmode mode);
 	
 	modes -
 		default - ie if mode is not specified the it will be in both in and out mode.
 		in - Opens the file in read mode.
 		out - Opens the file in write mode.
 		binary - Opens the file in binary mode.
 		app - Opens the file and append all the outputs at the end
 		ate - Opens the file and moves the control to the end of the file.
 		trunk - Removes the data in existing file.

	eg - fstream new_file;
	     new_file.open(“newfile.txt”, ios::out);
 	
 	We can combine the different modes using or symbol | eg - new_file.open(“new_file.txt”, ios::out | ios::app );
